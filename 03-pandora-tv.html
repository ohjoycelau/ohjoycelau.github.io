<h1>A digitally seamless Pandora</h1>
<h2>From Iron Man to Star Wars, portability and compactness are cool feats, the magic when something just works is really where you go oooh~</h2>

<p>With the last re-design, although improved usability, was simple and left the experience wanting. In a new iteration, I wanted to create space for intelligence and accommodate personality.</p>

<p>I revisited navigation, this time focusing on the elements of gesture, motion, and depth.</p>
      
<h3>Persistence is key</h3>

<p>Keeping navigation consistent here helps keep the user oriented, which we learned is especially important when you’re multi-tasking. I searched for a navigation that added value both in way finding and content.</p>
<p>A persistent side navigation highlights the three main experiences of Pandora.</p>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Now playing – your music right now</li>
    <li>Search (and assistant) – something smart</li>
    <li>Your collection – curated by you or for you</li>
  </ol>
</p>
					
<p>Decoupling x and y axes navigation to tell a better narrative of scale. Moving left to right to change scope; moving up and down to explore those contents. You are always 4 clicks from any other part of Pandora.</p>

<p>The disunion also helps keep long press affordances consistent; long press &uarr; to get to the top of a list, long press &larr; to jump to the outermost scope (top-level navigation).</p>
    
<h3>J.A.R.V.I.S. is that you?</h3>
<p>Just as J.A.R.V.I.S. reminds Tony Stark about his dates with Pepper, also calculates and advises on enemy weak points. I look forward to the day when Voice is readily available and smart enough on the platform, a direction Pandora was already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18183331/pandora-voice-mode-commands-music-streaming" target="blank">investing in</a>. Voice assists both menial and intelligent work. You can say ‘Hey Pandora, show me my Home Alone Jams playlist’ to ‘Hey Pandora, play me something new’.</p>

    
<p>The persistent side navigation allows Voice to take over without introducing a new visual pattern. It is balancing user feedback signals and content.</p>

<h2>“A re-style is where designers ruin your life by coming up with something prettier than they had previously come up with, resulting in you having to rewrite a bunch of CSS/LESS/SASS/etc”</h2>
<p>— Jacob Thornton, @<a href="https://twitter.com/fat" target="blank">fat</a></p>

<p>Have no fear, engineer — design systems to the rescue. As a part of the 2016 re-design, a component library and accompanying processes were successfully integrated into the 10 some people engineering team. A “re-style”? No&nbsp;problemo.</p>
