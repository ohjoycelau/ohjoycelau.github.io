						<b>Goals</b><br/>
						Replace the server auto generated data display with a more usable interface. The resulting dashboard will display and alert important events for engineers on-call and shown on a large screen in the team area.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Process</b><br/>
						It was challenging figuring out requirements on a subject I knew close to zero about. I conducted interviews with engineers on and related to the team, honing in on the data views needed. I neede to balance simplified summaries yet still empower engineers to find the complex data they needed.
